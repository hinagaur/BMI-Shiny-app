# BMI-Shiny-app

This application helps you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on your height and weight.

BMI is commonly used to categorize individuals into different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

This app provides real-time BMI calculation as you adjust your height and weight using the sliders.

Explore the BMI categories and visualize the distribution of BMI categories using the plots.
